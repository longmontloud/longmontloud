DESCRIPTION:This is an intimate live show in downtown Longmont\, Colorado presented by The Soundpost Sessions at The Times Collaborative featuring two songwriters and host Monica Marie LaBonte all on stage swapping songs and stories in-the-round. Music is from 7:30-9:30\, doors at 7:00. Join us for this very special ongoing musical series every other month!\n$18 Advance (reserved seating)\n$20 Day of Show\nThe Artists:\nBritt Devens https://www.brittdevens.com/\nBritt Devens is a musician who writes songs about hope\, heartbreak\, and recovery. A native of Fort Collins\, CO\, Devens uses her music to explore the vulnerabilities of her own experiences in life and to remind her audience of the importance of self-care. Promoting the message “Take Care of You” both mentally and physically - Devens’ music is for people who can relate to a struggle but still continue to have hope for a brighter day. She shares her story through the intimate lyrics and songs that she creates. Strong\, emotive vocals complement her unique guitar style\, making her a real standout in a sea of singer-songwriters. “If just one person can resonate with my music\, then I will have given back hope like music has given me hope through some of my hardest times.” Britt has released a number of singles and EPs\; her most recent effort\, “Here I Go Again” was released on August 25\, 2023\nEllsworth www.ellsworththefolksinger.com\nMaybe it’s their sincere lyrics or humorous stage presence that makes first time listeners become devoted fans of ELLSWORTH after only two songs. Maybe it’s the way ELLSWORTH presents themselves\, so natural and authentic\, with the fluidity of their gender finding its moment on stage and in their music. Either way\, ELLSWORTH “has a remarkable way of cracking open your soul and finding the hidden corners of your heart you've too long forgotten or didn't even know existed” (Sway Wild\, Dave McGraw and Mandy Fer).With a uniquely powerful voice and a knack for lyrical storytelling\, ELLSWORTH is an artist on the rise in Denver and around the world.Currently\, ELLSWORTH is a finalist in the 2022 Great American Song Contest\, and they recently placed their song\, Growing Pains\, in the Disney+ show Diary of a Future President. “[ELLSWORTH has] a stunningly pure voice\, boundless enthusiasm and a way with words that hugs deep into our hearts. They are a singer-songwriter that is finding their feet and it feels like they will only get better and better through time. Having talent is one thing but being sincere\, putting in the hard work and going for your dreams through undoubted trial and error\, is how you become truly great at what you set your mind to” (AnR Factory\, London\, UK).\nMonica Marie LaBonte monicamariemusic.com\nFrom a wide-eyed tike delicately pressing the keys of her mother’s upright piano to a seasoned artist taking various stages across the country\, Monica Marie LaBonte has always been guided by song.With the sharp ability to craft tracks that speak to the fragility and wonder of life\, the crystalline vocalist continues to attract listeners with her stirring blend of folk and country. At times\, her lyrics come across as wise whisperings from a dear friend. At others\, they hold all the vulnerability and transparency of raw confessions. A keen observer\, LaBonte bears witness to life’s magic and heartache and artfully weaves the intricacies of the human condition into tunes that possess undeniable intimacy\, grace and grit.In her over 10-year career\, the Colorado native has played hundreds of venues\, including the historic Gold Hill Inn and Planet Bluegrass. Whether belting out ballads in a small listening room or playing to tens of thousands at an open-air venue\, she brings a palpable authenticity to each gig.Known for her stint in mystic-Americana band Monocle\, her stellar musicianship and gift for commanding a stage shines just as bright in her solo work.Armed with an acoustic and her truth\, it’s clear LaBonte is pursuing her art for all the right reasons. Although her creative pursuits are guided by pure passion\, LaBonte hasn’t escaped critical praise and success. A finalist In the 2018 Songwriter Showcase\, at Rocky Mountain Folks Fest in Lyons\, Colo.\, she continues to impress with her art.A natural-born wordsmith — in the vein of Joni Mitchell and Alison Krauss — it’s easy to see why the songstress has packed coffeehouses\, held her own on the lineup at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and been hailed as having “a voice I trust” by fellow musician Daniel Rodriguez (founding member of Elephant Revival).Powerful\, yet understated — poetic\, yet real — LaBonte remains one to watch.\n\nLink: https://www.downtownlongmont.com/do/mixtape-songwriter-showcase-featuring-britt-devens-and-ellsworth
